# Java Framework Migration Workshop

## Project Purpose
This is a comprehensive hands-on workshop designed to guide enterprise teams through Java framework modernization using Amazon Q Developer IDE Extension. The workshop focuses on migrating applications from Java 8 + Spring 5.2.3 to Java 21 + Spring 6, targeting 27 enterprise applications across BDP (25 apps), BPT (2 apps), and BCN platforms.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Workshop Structure
- **8-hour core workshop** (9 AM - 5 PM) with optional 1.5-hour extension
- **5 progressive modules** covering environment setup, Java migration, Spring migration, testing, and platform validation
- **Hands-on exercises** with real sample application migration
- **Platform-specific validation** for JBoss EAP, WebSphere, and mainframe environments

### Sample Application
- **Pre-migration baseline**: Java 8 + Spring 5.2.3 + Spring Boot 2.2.4
- **Target state**: Java 21 + Spring 6 + Spring Boot 3.2.0
- **Complete user management service** with authentication, database integration, and comprehensive test suite
- **Real-world patterns** including javax to jakarta namespace migration, security configuration updates, and JUnit 4 to 5 migration

### Amazon Q Developer Integration
- **Code transformation** using /transform command for automated Java version upgrades
- **Interactive chat assistance** for migration guidance and troubleshooting
- **Inline code suggestions** for fixing compilation errors and implementing best practices
- **Code review capabilities** using /review command for validation and security checks

## Target Users and Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Enterprise development teams** modernizing legacy Java applications
- **Platform engineers** managing application deployments across multiple environments
- **Technical leads** planning and executing large-scale framework migrations
- **DevOps teams** validating applications on target platforms (JBoss EAP, WebSphere, mainframe)

### Use Cases
- **Framework modernization**: Systematic migration from Java 8 + Spring 5 to Java 21 + Spring 6
- **Dependency management**: Updating Maven dependencies and resolving version conflicts
- **Namespace migration**: Converting javax.* imports to jakarta.* for Jakarta EE compliance
- **Security configuration**: Modernizing Spring Security from WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to SecurityFilterChain
- **Test framework updates**: Migrating from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 with updated assertions and annotations
- **Platform validation**: Ensuring compatibility with enterprise platforms and databases (SQL Server, DB2, IBM MQ, MongoDB)

## Value Proposition
- **Accelerated migration**: Reduces manual effort through AI-assisted code transformation
- **Risk mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and validation at each migration step
- **Platform compatibility**: Ensures applications work across diverse enterprise environments
- **Knowledge transfer**: Builds team expertise in modern Java development practices
- **Repeatable process**: Establishes standardized migration methodology for future projects
